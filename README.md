PMKB ID3 Tag Extractor
======================

About
-----

This is the Personal Music Knowledge Base (PMKB) [ID3 Tag](http://id3.org/) extractor. This [RDFizer](http://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf) is a fork of the [MP3 File Extractor](http://aperture.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/aperture/aperture/trunk/core/src/main/java/org/semanticdesktop/aperture/extractor/mp3/) of the [Aperture](http://aperture.sourceforge.net/) Semantic Web framework. It makes use of the [RDF2Go](http://semanticweb.org/wiki/RDF2Go) framework as a triple-centric API.

Usage
-----

<b>Attention</b>: the classes in [smiy.pmkb.vocabulary](https://github.com/zazi/pmkb-id3-tag-extractor/tree/master/src/main/java/smiy/pmkb/vocabulary) are automatically generated by a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build process. After initial project setup one might "Override and Update" them from the existing classes in the [PMKB ID3 Tag extractor repository](https://github.com/zazi/pmkb-id3-tag-extractor), because this Maven build process can't handle individuals (currently, this is added manually).

PS
--

The [old project repository location at SourceForge](http://smiy.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smiy/pmkb-aperture-extractor/) is now deprecated. All new developments will be pushed to this repository location here at GitHub.
