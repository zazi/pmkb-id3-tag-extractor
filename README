Attention: the classes in smiy.pmkb.vocabulary are automatically generated by a Maven build process. After initial project setup one might 
"Override and Update" them from the existing classes in the SMIY SVN repository, because this Maven build process can't handle individuals 
(the classes are currently created manually).
